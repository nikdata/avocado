The {avocado} package provides a summary of weekly Hass avocado sales
for the contiguous United States. The underlying data are from [The Hass
Avocado Board](https://hassavocadoboard.com) (free registration
required). Hass Avocados are the most popular variety of avocados sold
in the United States and the Haas Avocado Board (HAB) provides crucial
data on them to growers and marketers.

The HAB makes this information available to anyone who may be interested
(free registration required). An important note to remember is that the
term ‘units’ typically refers to 1 avocado. It does not refer to
avocados in terms of weight, bags, etc. The HAB does not provide (at
least publicly) actual piece-count sales to retailers or consumers.

## About the PLUs

The {avocadoo} package consists of 3 primary
[PLUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_look-up_code):

- 4046: non-organic small/medium Hass Avocados (~3-5 oz); also known as
  Hass \#60 size or smaller
- 4225: non-organic large Hass Avocados (~8-10 oz); also known as Hass
  \#40 size and Hass \#48 size
- 4770: non-organic extra large Hass Avocados (~10-15 oz); also known as
  Hass \#36 size or larger

Organic avocados have the digit 9 prefixed to the non-organic PLUs: \*
94046: organic small/medium Hass Avocados (~3-5 oz) \* 94225: organic
large Hass Avocados (~8-10 oz) \* 94770: organic extra large Hass
Avocados (~10-15 oz)

## Bags vs PLU

HAB also tracks avocado sales in bags of varying sizes. Since 2021, HAB
does not break down units of avocados sold by bag size (e.g., small,
large, extra large). Bags can consist of multiple avocados and can
weights of bags can vary.

more information.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nikdata/avocado", ref = 'main')
```

## Datasets

The {avocado} package consists of three different datasets:

- `hass_usa`: weekly contiguous US avocado sales at the country level
- `hass_region`: weekly contiguous US avocado sales at the region level
- `hass_market`: weekly contiguous US avocado sales at the
  city/sub-region (i.e., market) level

### Example

The `hass_market` dataset provides a weekly sales summary of Hass
Avocado sales in the contiguous US (subdivided by region and select
cites/sub-regions within each ‘parent’ region):

``` r
library(avocado)
dplyr::glimpse(hass_market)

## Use Cases

Some potential use cases include:

- Determining peak sale periods for each market
- Determining which PLU is most popular in some major cities (e.g.,
  Chicago, Los Angeles, etc.)
- Differences between organic and non-organic Hass Avocados
